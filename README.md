# datalibjs
A small library for gathering data and creating reports.

## Prerequisites

This project requires NodeJS (version 8 or later) and NPM.
[Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) are really easy to install.
To make sure you have them available on your machine,
try running the following command.

```sh
$ npm -v && node -v
8.1.2
v16.13.2
```
Start with creating a folder where you will work on your reporting tasks:

Open your folder with vscode.

Run the following commands on a Terminal.

```cmd
$ npm init
```
 It will prompt you for input for a few aspects of the project in the following order:

* The project's name,
* The project's initial version,
* The project's description,
* The project's entry point (meaning the project's main file),
* The project's test command (to trigger testing with something like Standard)
* The project's git repository (where the project source can be found)
* The project's keywords (basically, tags related to the project)
* The project's license (this defaults to ISC - most open-source Node.js projects are MIT)

Complete as needed, you can simply hit Return or Enter to accept the suggestion and move on to the next prompt.

```sh
$ npm i --local datalibjs
